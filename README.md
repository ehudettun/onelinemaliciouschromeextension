# onelinemaliciouschromeextension
a one line extention for google chrome, which sends to server every url the user visits, along with the cookies. 

This is just a proof of concept. Use responsibly. If you try to make it into an extention on the chrome extenion store I'm sure it'll be blocked immediately.
